The most interesting and the thought that i thought about the entrey is that i found was about how do they start and what makes them do their arts and their different opinions and ideas about an art that they made and the most interesting part was and if i was involved in this i would start looking and searching up for different and websites that might help me to do my art and iw ould watch the best artist or the artist that inspires me alot and look up their history and what've they been through in their life that makes them succsess. And the most challenging work in my opinion was from victor vasely because he've been through alot of obstacles in his life such as family problems and high low sit situations in his life but he didn't give up he created such an awesome creativly creative arts such as physical arts and visual arts that are on the papers and another thing is how he got fame he tried to spread his arts between people which wasn't easy and that's why i pick victor because as i see this is the most challenging work in my opinion
